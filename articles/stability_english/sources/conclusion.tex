\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we study stability properties of the phase-field model
for electrical breakdown channel evolution.
The central result is a classification of the
equilibrium solutions of the model and their stability.
From practical point of view, these results allows to
make meaningful conclusions regarding qualitative and quantitative
properties of the model. Particularly it was shown under which
conditions small perturbations of the equilibrium solutions
develop into channel-like structure typical for of electrical breakdown
process.

Besides this, a simple explicit finite-difference scheme
for solution of the model in spatially one-dimensional setting is considered.
The main question addressed here are stability conditions which guaranties
correctness of the simulations. Deep connections between
stability conditions of the model and the one of the
finite-difference scheme are shown.
The presented results of the numerical simulations confirms
predictions of the theoretical analysis of the model.
